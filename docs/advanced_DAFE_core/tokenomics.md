# Tokenomics and Economic Model

## Overview

The tokenomics of our project is designed to create a sustainable and incentivized ecosystem for all participants. Our token, **TOKEN_NAME**, serves as the primary medium of exchange within the platform, enabling users to access services, participate in governance, and earn rewards.

## Token Details

- **Token Name**: TOKEN_NAME
- **Token Symbol**: TKN
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 TKN
- **Decimals**: 18

## Distribution

The total supply of TKN will be distributed as follows:

| Category                | Percentage | Amount          |
|------------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Public Sale**        | 40%        | 400,000,000 TKN  |
| **Team**               | 20%        | 200,000,000 TKN  |
| **Advisors**           | 10%        | 100,000,000 TKN  |
| **Ecosystem Fund**     | 15%        | 150,000,000 TKN  |
| **Liquidity Pool**     | 10%        | 100,000,000 TKN  |
| **Reserve**            | 5%         | 50,000,000 TKN   |

### Vesting Schedule

To ensure long-term commitment from the team and advisors, the following vesting schedule will be implemented:

- **Team Tokens**: 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff (25% released after 1 year, then 1/48th released monthly).
- **Advisor Tokens**: 2-year vesting with a 6-month cliff (50% released after 6 months, then 1/36th released monthly).

## Utility of the Token

The TKN token will have several key utilities within the ecosystem:

1. **Transaction Fees**: Users will pay transaction fees in TKN for using the platform's services.
2. **Staking**: Users can stake TKN to earn rewards and participate in governance decisions.
3. **Governance**: TKN holders will have voting rights to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, including upgrades and fee structures.
4. **Incentives**: Users will earn TKN as rewards for participating in various activities, such as providing liquidity or contributing to the ecosystem.

## Economic Model

### Supply and Demand

The economic model is designed to create a balanced supply and demand for TKN:

- **Deflationary Mechanism**: A portion of transaction fees will be burned, reducing the total supply over time and increasing scarcity.
- **Incentives for Holding**: Staking rewards will encourage users to hold TKN rather than sell, stabilizing the token's price.

### Market Strategy

To promote the adoption of TKN, we will implement the following strategies:

- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with other projects and platforms to increase the utility of TKN.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Launch targeted marketing campaigns to raise awareness and attract new users.
- **Community Engagement**: Foster a strong community through social media, forums, and events to encourage participation and feedback.

## Conclusion

The tokenomics of TOKEN_NAME is designed to create a sustainable and thriving ecosystem that benefits all participants. By aligning incentives and providing utility, we aim to ensure the long-term success of the project and its community.
